				<p>Please indicate you have understood and agree with the 
					information provided to you. Any specific concerns should be discussed with your doctor/clinician performing 
					the procedure <b> prior to signing the consent form. </b>
				</p>
				<p>The doctor has explained the child's medical condition and prognosis to me. The doctor also explained the 
					relevant diagnostic treatment options that are available to the child and their associated risks, including the 
					risks of not having the procedure.</p>
				<p>The risks of the procedure have been explained to me, including the risks that are specific to the child and the 
					likely outcomes. I have had an opportunity to discuss and clarify any concerns with the doctor or proceduralist.</p>
				<p>I understand that the result/outcome of the treatment/procedure cannot be guaranteed.</p>
				<p>I understand that if immediate life-threatening events happen during the procedure, the child will be treated as 
					necessary to save the child's life or to prevent serious harm to the child's health.</p>
				<p>I understand that if the child is treated as a public patient no guarantee can be provided that a particular 
					doctor/clinician will perform the procedure and that the doctor/proceduralist performing the procedure may 
					be undergoing training.</p>
				<p>I understand that tissue samples and blood removed as part of the procedure or treatment will be used for 
					diagnosis and common pathology practices (which may include audit, training, test development and research), 
					and will be stored or disposed of sensitively by the hospital.</p>
				<p>I agree for my/this child's medical record to be accessed by staff involved in the child's clinical care and for it to 
					be used for approved quality assurance activities, including clinical audit.</p>
				<p>If a staff member is exposed to my/this child's blood, I consent to a sample of blood being collected and tested 
					for infectious diseases. I understand that I will be informed if the sample is tested, and that I will be given the 
					results of the tests.</p>
				<p>On behalf of the child, I give consent for my/this child to undergo the procedure/s or treatment/s as 
					documented on this form.</p>
				<p>I understand that I have the right to change my mind at any time before the procedure is undertaken, including 
					after I have signed this form. I understand that I must inform the doctor if this occurs.</p>
